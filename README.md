# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview

The results of the first assigment show a correlation between the city type, number of drivers and average fare. Our analysis included different charts explaining how our businness is divided and what is the area with more revenue. 

A new assigment was received to complement the previous results. This time we will include a multiple-line graph displaying the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

The following picture shows the results based on the 3 different city types.

It was predectible to assume that the largest number of drivers and trips are located in the Urban city type. This trend confirms that the city has more transportation traffic, compared to the other two types of cities. 

It is not a surprise either, that the Urban's total fare is the highest result. This is obviously due to the number of services on demand. The request for taxi services is significatly lower on the Rural and Suburban areas which affect the total fare value. 

Therefore, the Rural area has the highest average fare per ride and per driver; in consequence, we can confirm the transportation increases considerably for people living out of urban area. 

Another important result is the one relate to the Suburban type. It keeps the second position in all the statistical results. 

## Summary

As part of the assigment, we will include business recommendations based on the analysis obtained.

- Increase the number of drivers in Suburban and Rural areas: I think that a good strategy to increase revenues would be to increase the number of drivers in the Suburban and Rural areas. For instance, by duplicating the number of drivers in the suburban area we may obtain almost the same "total fare" value for the Urban area. Moreover, the average fare per driver on the Rural area is more than 3 times the average of the Urban area. This is another indicator to analyze a possible investment out of the center of the city.

- Average fare per ride and per driver are the lower in the Urban area: we should consider additional actions to take advantage of the higher number of drivers and rides in the Urban area. For example, addinng an additional fee during holidays or rush hours. 

- The tendency is constant for the 3 city types analized during 2019: this result can support new stratergies to increase our revenue. If the requests for taxi services maintain this tendency, we can take the risk to apply new ideas without causing a major impact on the business. 

- Fares increase in March: Based on the Multiple-line graph there is an increment for the 3 city types in March. We should consider a deeper analysis for this month and include research of events during this part of the year. 

- Rural area in April: the rural area shows good results in April. Considering this area with the highest average fare per driver in our analysis, it would be worth it to increase the number of drivers during this month. It may be beneficial for our strategy to run additional research about what kind of events or activities are related to this period.
